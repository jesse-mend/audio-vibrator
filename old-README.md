# audio-vibrator
This app enables you to find the resonant frequencies of nearby objects using a bank of easily tunable audio oscillators. Once tuned, you can use the oscillators to play the room like a drumset (requires a subwoofer). It's fun, loud and guaranteed to piss off your neighbors! So do it while they're not home ;)
